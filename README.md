Plugin Support Forum: 

Bbpress is a great forum product, I used it build many forums, but in recent days when I build a site which focus the forum, I found a problem -- there are no bbpress login link, bbpress register link, bbpress forget password links in bbpress forum index pages or bbpress single forum pages or bbpress forum pages or bbpress topic pages. 
I try to find a solution, the result is I understand in the current time, I had to put the forum login link at the widget or I had to tell users to how to find the log in link in forum topics or add register/login links in the menu items... 
For webmasters, the widget is rare asset and the sidebar area have no so many place to put a big log in widget..., for users, many of users/clients is not good at forum scripts or web sites, and they have no time to find the log in link in your sites..., the result is many of users just leave away from your forums, as a webmaster, this is not good because you used so many days/nights to build the site and offer the services. 
I think the most easy way is put the log in/register links in the forum pages or in the topic pages, for this reason, I developed a new bbpress plugin: Bbpress Login Register Links On Forum Page And Topic. 

<h4>How To Use:</h4>
It is very easy to install and use, please just upload the plugin and active it, no any setting in backend needed, you will find at the top of forum pages, there are log in / register and Lost / Password links,  when a user is logged in, the login link will turn into logout link. Also if you use some log in plugins like theme my login which changed login/register links, the plugin will still works well, how it looks? Please check screenshots. :)
